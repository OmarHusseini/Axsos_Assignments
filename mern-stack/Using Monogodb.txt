1-Create students' collection:

db.createCollection('students')


2-Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
3-Create 5 students with the appropriate info:

db.students.insertOne({name:"husseni",home_state:"btata",lucky_number:6,birthday:{month:4,day:4,year:2000}})
db.students.insertOne({name:"salhi",home_state:"btata",lucky_number:5,birthday:{month:4,day:4,year:1265}})
db.students.insertOne({name:"majd",home_state:"dora",lucky_number:4,birthday:{month:4,day:4,year:2007}})
db.students.insertOne({name:"majd",home_state:"dora",lucky_number:4,birthday:{month:4,day:4,year:2007}})
db.students.insertOne({name:"atout",home_state:"waseem",lucky_number:7,birthday:{month:4,day:4,year:8000}})
 
4-Get all students.
db.students.find()

5-Retrieve all students who are from Palestinian (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).

db.students.find({home_state:"btata"})

6-Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3

db.students.find({lucky_number:{$gt:6}})

7-Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', and 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

db.students.updateMany( {}, { $set: { interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'] } } )

8-Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update( {_id: ObjectId('686f9a7abee30617e3718dcc')}, { $set: { interests: ['coding','MongoDB'] } } )


9-Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update( {_id: ObjectId('686f9a7abee30617e3718dcc')}, { $push: { interests: ""taxes} } )

10-Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update( {_id: ObjectId('686f9a7abee30617e3718dcc')}, { $pull: { interests: ""taxes} } )

11-Remove all students who are from batata.
db.students.deleteMany({home_state:"btata"})

12-Remove a student by name.
db.students.deleteOne({name:"frehat"})

13-Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)

db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number:{$gt:5}})


14-Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.

db.students.updateMany( {}, { $set: { number_of_belts:0} } )

15-Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

db.students.updateMany( {home_state:"dora"}, { $set: { number_of_belts:1} } )

16-Add an 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.


 db.students.updateMany({},{ $currentDate: { updated_at: true } })
